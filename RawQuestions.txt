Bubbles the orangutan is also cursed with eternal life until she can correctly sort a randomly shuffled set of flashcards containing one of every word in the English language into alphabetical order. Bubbles is somewhat smarter than Bogo and approaches this task by going through the entire set and comparing the card she is looking at with the one immediately before. If that card is alphabetically before the sequentially previous card, she swaps their two positions and moves on to next card. When Bubbles reaches the end of the set, she goes back to the beginning and starts again with the updated order. Bubbles practices on a 10 card set of single digit numbers instead of words and after optimizing her technique, she can sort the practice set on average in just 100 seconds.
